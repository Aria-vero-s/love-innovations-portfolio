        <p>In the summer of 2019, Ben bought a narrowboat in London. It was old, tired, and full of mystery: no builder’s plate, no clear history. A centre-cockpit design with doors fore and aft, an aft kitchen and sleeping area, and a forward saloon that may once have been used for cargo. Most of the hull had been reinforced with fibreglass, but the structure was still largely wood — and time had not been kind to it. It had only one clue to its past: a name; <strong>Flight</strong>.</p>

        <p>At the time, he had a steady engineering job — but the routine was draining him.</p>
        
        <blockquote class="border-l-4 pl-4 italic text-muted-foreground">
          "It felt like I was just existing," he later said.
          "Wake up, work, go home, repeat. I wanted out."
        </blockquote>

        <p>He left it behind and threw himself into the boat full-time. The first fix? The bow — <em>rotten and splintering</em>. He stripped it back and rebuilt it using <strong>wood slats in varied stains</strong>, finished with a coat of marine varnish. It was practical, but also beautiful — a signature touch that hinted at what was to come.</p>

        <p>This was the beginning: the first cut, the first decision, the first transformation. There would be many more.</p>

        <p>By early 2020, <em>Structural repairs were no longer optional</em>. He tore out the crumbling walls and rebuilt them from scratch — but instead of simply replacing what was there, he reimagined the space entirely.</p>

        <p>The centre cockpit, once open, became an enclosed room with solid walls and a roof. The doors? They didn’t swing out but swung up, like the DeLorean in Back to the Future.</p>
        
        <blockquote class="border-l-4 pl-4 italic text-muted-foreground">
          “Why not do it with some style?” — Doc Brown and apparently, Ben.
        </blockquote>
        
        <p><em>By May, COVID had arrived in London</em>. Streets were quiet. No one quite knew what was coming. Ben quietly stocked up on nonperishable food — <i>just in case</i> — and kept building.</p>

        <p>With the cockpit sealed, he turned inward. Since the floor were built over the bilge, he lowered it to create enough headspace to stand tall. Then came the rear cabin — rotten roof out, clean timber in.</p>

        <p>But the biggest change was yet to come: <em>an extension</em>. Using two barrels strapped to the back for buoyancy, Ben built a raised platform. At first, it looked like a box with railings — but it soon evolved into a <em>new steering cabin</em>. He repurposed the back window as a <em>windshield</em>, added two small round portholes, and cut in a flap for air. A second little room was born.</p>

        <p>By the end of the year, Flight looked… experimental. A little like papier-mâché.</p>

        <p>But it was growing. And most importantly — it was home.</p>

        <p>By 2021, Ben was cruising along, learning the rhythms of life on the canal. Moving, mooring and, meeting people. It was no longer just a project — it was becoming a new lifestyle.</p>

        <p>With the structure mostly repaired, it was time to bring some visual harmony to the boat. Ben painted the entire top section with a <em>golden-tinted marine paint</em> — meant to tie everything together.</p>

        <p>The windows, still <em>prone to leaking</em>, went through another round of restoration — an ongoing saga that would haunt the boat again and again.</p>

        <blockquote class="border-l-4 pl-4 italic text-muted-foreground">
          “Flight is teaching me that patience and persistence aren't the same thing. Patience is waiting for the perfect weather to work on leak repairs. Persistence is working on them anyway because the forecast shows rain for the next two weeks.” — Ben
        </blockquote>

        <p>The rear extension was finally starting to look like it had always been part of Flight. <strong>Flushed doors</strong>, seamless siding, and a new coat of paint along the bottom helped the structure blend in. Inside, the <strong>new flooring</strong> was finished — and with a few leftover wood slats, Ben built matching <strong>indoor steps</strong> to climb in/out of the boat.</p>

        <p>The fireplace was <em>shifted slightly</em> to improve the flow of the room. In the bedroom, Ben added a <em>built-in desk and storage</em>. The kitchen got a serious upgrade: a <strong>new countertop, sink</strong>, continued <strong>flooring</strong>, <strong>benches</strong>, and a small <strong>dining table</strong>. Wood trims were added to the ceiling, tying the interior together.</p>

        <p>In the details, the boat started to show its character:<p>
        <ol>
          <li>A phone charger and new lighting in the bedroom.</li>
          <li>An exterior red light that glowed like a car’s taillight.</li>
          <li>The DeLorean-style doors got their final touches.</li>
        </ol>

        <p>But of course — it was still a boat. There was always more to do.</p>

        <p>By 2022, the inside of Flight finally looked <strong>lived in</strong>. The kitchen had become part of Ben’s daily rhythm — always stocked with tea, honey, and a pan on the stove. The bedroom shelves were filled with his things. Art hung on the walls. The boat was no longer just a build — it was his home.</p>

        <p>But what about the bathroom? That’s because, until now, there wasn’t much to mention: it only consisted of a <strong>portable toilet</strong>, and Ben took his showers at the gym.</p>

        <p>This year, that changed. He decided to waterproof the bathroom and build a proper shower — custom-shaped to fit the tiny space. The base was hand-made using fiberglass and hardened plastic, molded into a perfect fit. Simple, but clever. And very Ben.</p>

        <p>Meanwhile, disaster was creeping in... Remember the gold paint from 2021? Well, it didn’t age well. The sun baked it, the heat cracked it, and soon it began peeling off in wide strips. Water seeped through. The boat began leaking… again.</p>

        <p>Ben stripped back the gold layer, filled the cracks with fiberglass putty, and sanded endlessly. The surface dried into stiff, spiky peaks. Flight looked like papier-mâché. Again.</p>

        <blockquote class="border-l-4 pl-4 italic text-muted-foreground">
          “You think you’re nearly done, and suddenly it’s back to bare bones. But that’s boats for you.” — Ben

        <p>A year of sanding, sealing, patching... The work never really ends. But the boat kept floating.</p>

        <p>By 2023, one area remained mostly unfinished: <strong>the cockpit extension interior</strong>. That changed this year, starting with full <em>insulation and painting</em>. But Ben didn’t stop at making it liveable — he made it <em>drivable</em>.</p>
    
        <p>Using a technique he'd never tried before — layering <strong>fabric and resin</strong> — Ben began sculpting the walls into smooth, curved surfaces that looked more like the molded interior of a vintage car than a boat cabin. It was a nod to his other passion: cars.</p>
    
        <p>He built the dashboard by hand, forming custom curves and mounting panels that resembled a glove box and console. There was even a <strong>built-in iPad holder</strong> for music while cruising — plus a whole row of light switches (that didn’t actually do anything yet). The boat uses a simple outboard motor with a wheel connection — no ignition panel needed. But hey, the switches look cool.</p>

        <p>More sanding. More shaping. More little exterior touch-ups, as always. The transformation kept creeping forward.</p>

        <p>By 2024, most of the boat was watertight. The last persistent roof leaks were nearly gone — and while the <em>gold paint</em> damage still needed sorting, the sheer amount of <strong>fiberglass and structural reinforcement</strong> Ben had added by now would probably outlast him.</p>
    
        <p>Instead of removing the original <strong>paddle holders</strong> on the roof — relics from who-knows-when — Ben decided to keep them. He repaired them with fresh fiberglass, sanded them smooth, and preserved them as a nod to the boat’s past.</p>
    
        <p>There was still a lot of sanding… and fiberglassing… and then more sanding. But the transformation was starting to feel complete. The new <strong>windshield glass</strong> had been fully installed and now looked <em>seamless</em> from inside and out.</p>
    
        <p>Ben also made a bold decision: to wrap the exterior of the cockpit extension in <strong>carbon fibre</strong> — giving the boat a sleek, modern contrast to its vintage wood and quirky design.</p>
    
        <p>Inside, however, the years of leaks had left their mark. In the bedroom, some of the wood had rotted from water damage. So Ben did what he always does: <strong>cut out, fiberglass, sand</strong>… repeat. Sometimes, the inside of the boat became coated in white fiberglass & saw dust like a snowstorm had hit.</p>

        <p>But the sawdust wasn’t done with him yet.</p>

        <p>It’s 2025, and the bedroom is now <strong>completely dry</strong>, and most of the boat has finally shed its leaks. Only a few small drips remain around the kitchen.</p>
    
        <p>The <strong>kitchen counter</strong> was redesigned and rebuilt yet again, this time slimmer, with more efficient <strong>under-counter storage</strong> to open up the space.</p>
    
        <p>Ben’s car obsession continues to show through — this time in the form of a custom-made <strong>exhaust modeled after a Porsche</strong>, and it looks like it could launch the boat into orbit.</p>
    
        <p>The <strong>carbon fibre wrap</strong> now fully encircles the cockpit extension, and the back flap has been fitted with a <strong>screen door</strong> to keep the bugs out while still letting the breeze in.</p>
    
        <p>From the outside, the once-mismatched materials are now replaced with <em>clean lines, continuous trim, and molded surfaces</em>. The cleat mounts, the joins, the curves — all feel strong and deliberate. There’s no more paper-mâché patchwork. It’s solid work.</p>
    
        <blockquote class="border-l-4 pl-4 italic text-muted-foreground">
          “Somewhere along the way, Flight stopped being a project and started being a companion. That's the real story of Flight—not just the transformation of a forgotten boat, but true connection in a world that often feels disposable.” — Ben
        </blockquote>
    
        <p>There’s more to come. Interior storage, maybe even <strong>hot water</strong> one day. Extra power. New systems. But for now, the boat is home — and it's beautiful.</p>
        <p>Today, Ben can be found cruising along the canal in London and he now aspire to design and build more boats for others.</p>
